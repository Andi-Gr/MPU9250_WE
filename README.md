# MPU9250_WE
An Arduino library for the 9-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. It contains many example sketches with lots of comments to make it easy to use. 

In addition you will find soon a blog post in German and English language on my website:

If you find bugs please inform me. If you like the library it would be great if you could give it a star.
